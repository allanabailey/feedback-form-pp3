# Allana - Feedback Form Portfolio Project 3 with Code Institute


## Brief Overview  
This project was created as part of Code Instituteâ€™s Diploma in Full Stack Software Development. This is portfolio project 3, a project requiring us to create a back end application in Python and deploy it on Heroku. The deployed site can be found [here](https://feedback-form-pp3.herokuapp.com/).

### Description
A web application built and designed for business owners and/or those in the hospitality industry to gather, enter and analyse feedback from customers more easily than traditional manual processes. It has been designed to work in conjunction with both manually and digitally submitted forms and present average scores to the user to provide useful insights into their business and custom satisfaction.

### Features
As a back end web application, there are no front end features as this utilises the template terminal supplied by Code Institute. However the application itself provides a mixture of average scores, analyses the highest and lowest scores of the organisation, and produces both a readable print for users, as well as updating a user friendly google sheet that would be accessible to all in a real worl application.

### Goals
* Application Goals:
    * Provide users with an option to manually enter feedback data not submitted digitally via the google form.
    * Allow users/companies to easily identify their highest and lowest scoring areas on a monthly basis.
    * Provide insights to areas of improvement for companies.
    * Offer a more user-friendly view of data via an updated google sheet linked to both the terminal application and the google forms submitted.
  
* Personal Goals:
    * Create a back end web application using Python for my portfolio.
    * Build on and improve my knowledge in Python.
    * Learn about the various libraries and modules available in Python.
    * Become comfortable with the deployment process on Heroku.
    * Create a back end web application with potential real world application.
